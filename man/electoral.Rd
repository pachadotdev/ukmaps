\description{
Electoral boundaries for the United Kingdom including
Westminster Parliamentary Constituencies (WPC), Electoral Wards, and
District Electoral Areas (DEA) for Northern Ireland. Each electoral boundary
is hierarchically linked to its parent Local Authority District.
}
\details{
The electoral dataset preserves hierarchical relationships where each
electoral boundary (WPC or Ward) is properly linked to its parent Local Authority
District through the lad_code field. For example, "Finchley and Golders Green" WPC
and "Golders Green" Ward both belong to Barnet LAD (E09000003).
